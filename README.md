This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

In this project there is a login page, when client enter phone number, the userId will be saved in the local storage and redirect to dashboard.
If the userId is removed, the user redirect to auth page and need enter the mobile number again. Also the form validate with zod.

In this project, I used typescript, sass, axios, zod and react hook form.
